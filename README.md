## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Focus on Tier 3 Cities:** Given that Tier 3 locations drive the most revenue, expansion and marketing efforts should be prioritized in these regions.
2. **Promote Low Fat Items:** As Low Fat items contribute nearly double the revenue of Regular fat items, inventory should be weighted heavily toward these preferences.
3. **Optimize Supermarket Type 1:** This outlet type is the most successful; identifying its operational strengths can help improve lower-performing formats like Grocery Stores.
